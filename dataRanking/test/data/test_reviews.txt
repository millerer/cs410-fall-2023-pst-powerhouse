originally played alan wake xbox subsequently picked pc one crazy daily deals many pros cons exist versions game game good mid generation graphics soundtrack likewise one major problem game excused degree necessitated storyline dark lot ways almost complete darkness hinder effects horror storyline help interlude periods day time come realize completely safe whereas nighttime sequences enemies seemingly pop ground nothingness combat relatively simple master puzzles game barely puzzles much quick time events game suffer serious dose repetition side effect boss fights really called typically slightly bigger dude chip away piece time away minions story kinda unique videogame obviously borrows heavily john carpenter mouth madness david lynch twin peaks take perhaps really noteworthy item voice acting actually quite liked extremely high standards since days dragon quest viii koudelka fun game touch long repetitious good
understand many people say game looks great looks outdated garbage overhyped piece crap
funny arcade racing game ever love excellent physics damage model cars
